# TestAutomation

Instructions to run the project:
1)Please import as a maven project in eclipse or anyother compatible ediotrs.
2)Please allow all the maven depedencies to download
3)There are two feature files for 2 Scenarios asked
4)Once run a html report can be generated from same
5)Page object model has been used where ever applicable

Assumptions & Queries
Scenario number 1 was asking to validate added item from order history, however I wasnt able to find any order history page like amazon or any online shopping cart, 
hence whatever was possible in that situation I did.

Improvements
I assumed this assignment should take max 1-2 hrs and hence there is for sure improvement chances like using data tables, or adding more edge case scenarios, exception handling
better assertions and more Object oriented POM structure.

However in 1.5 hrs this is what I could do.
Hope this would be useful and helpful for the process of evaluation.

Thanks
